**********EFFECTS**********

--Tidal has lots of effects we can use to change the way things sound.

-- vowel is a filter which adds a vowel sound
-- try a, e, i, o and u

d1 $ sound "drum drum drum drum" # n "0 1 0 2"

d1 $ sound "drum drum drum drum" # n "0 1 0 2" # vowel "a"

-- We can use the mini notation to create sequences of effects too:

d1 $ sound "drum drum drum drum" # n "0 1 0 2" # vowel "a o e e"

-- You can add a non-vowel letter to pause the vowel effect

d1 $ sound "drum drum drum drum" # n "0 1 0 2" # vowel "a o p p"

-- Tidal does its best to map patterns across to one another

d1 $ sound "drum drum drum drum" # n "0 1 0 2" # vowel "a o e"

-- The structure comes from the left - try swapping the parameters

d1 $ vowel "a [o o] ~ i" # sound "drum" # n "0 1 0 2"

-- We'll learn a bit more about how to manipulate structure later :)

-- gain changes the volume of different sounds

d1 $ sound "bd hh sn:1 hh sn:1 hh" # gain "1 0.7 0.5"

-- speed can be used to pitch samples
-- (we can also use note to do this, but that's for later)

-- speed affects the speed of playback,
-- e.g. 2 = play the sample twice as fast and move the note up an octave

d1 $ sound "numbers:1 numbers:2 numbers:3 numbers:4" # speed "1 1.5 2 0.5"

-- Or we can take the pattern from the speed parameter

d1 $ speed "1*2 2*2 4*6" # sound "jungbass:6"

-- pan allows us to create stereo effects - 0 = left, 0.5 = middle, 1 = right

d1 $ sound "numbers:1 numbers:2 numbers:3 numbers:4" # pan "0 0.5 1"

-- shape adds distortion (but be careful - it also makes the sound much louder)

d1 $ sound "kurt:4 kurt:4"

d1 $ sound "kurt:4 kurt:4" # shape "0 0.78" # gain "0.7"

-- feeling brave ?
-- Try more effects:

-- delay / delaytime / delayfeedback / cutoff / resonance / room / size /crush
