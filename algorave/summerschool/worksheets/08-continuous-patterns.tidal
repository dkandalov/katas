**********CONTINUOUS PATTERNS**********

{- Most often we deal with _discrete_ patterns, those with events that
 have a beginning and ending.
   There are also _continuous_ patterns, which continuously vary.
   Lets listen to some:
-}

-- Sine wave:

d1 $ sound "bd*16" |< pan sine

-- |< tells tidal to get the structure from the left
-- we'll cover this in more detail later

-- Continous patterns tend to give you numbers between 0 and 1. You
-- can change that with the 'range' function, e.g. for values from 1 to 2:

d1 $ sound "bd*16" |< speed (range 1 12 sine) |< pan sine

-- (In this case we could have just added 1 to get the same range)

d1 $ sound "bd*16" |< speed (sine + 1)

-- Triangular wave:

d1 $ sound "bd*16" |< pan tri

d1 $ sound "bd*16" |< speed (range 1 2 tri)

-- Sawtooth wave:

d1 $ sound "bd*16" |< pan saw

d1 $ sound "bd*16" |< speed (range 1 2 saw)

-- These continuous patterns have infinite detail, but we can only
-- hear them if we 'sample' them.

-- The >| operator tells tidal to take the structure from the right -
-- in this case the speed pattern, with is a continuous sawtooth. We
-- don't hear anything because the result is continuous - its events
-- don't have a beginning and end to hear!

d1 $ sound "bd" >| speed (range 1 2 saw)

-- We can fix it by transforming the sawtooth to make it discrete,
-- e.g. with the 'segment' function,
-- this samples the pattern at a fixed rate:

d1 $ sound "bd" >| speed (segment 16 $ range 1 2 saw)

-- Another way is to use "struct" to sample it with a boolean
-- true/false pattern (the 't' stands for 'true'):

d1 $ sound "bd" >| speed (struct "t ~ t ~ ~ t t" $ range 1 2 saw)

-- (we'll cover boolean patterns in a bit more detail later)

-- Or we can go back to taking the structure from a different part of
-- the pattern, by switching back to the |< operator.

d1 $ sound "bd(5,8,<0 2>)" |< speed (range 1 12 saw)

-- Random streams

-- `rand` is also gives a continuous pattern, of random numbers:

d1 $ sound "arpy*4 arpy*3" |< speed (range 1 4 rand)

-- More on randomness on another tidal worksheet..
